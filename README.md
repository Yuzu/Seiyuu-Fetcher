# Seiyuu Fetcher

Seiyuu Fetcher is a handy web app that will retrieve a given seiyuu's top 10 most popular roles.

## Usage

Enter the name of a seiyuu/voice actor from Japanese media and the web app will query the [AniList API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/) for the seiyuu's 10 most popular main character roles.

If the seiyuu does not have 10 main character roles, next in priority will be supporting roles, followed by background roles.

## Contributing
This is a pretty simple web app that replicates functionality you can find on AniList anyways.

It's my first time writing anything in JavaScript and HTML and CSS for that matter, so pointers would be greatly appreciated!
